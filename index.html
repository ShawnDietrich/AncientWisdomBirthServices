    <h1>What Do Doulas Do?</h1>
    <div class="purposeText">
      <!--purpose 1-->
      <h3>PHYSICAL SUPPORT</h3>
      <p>As a birth doula, I offer women physical support throughout their pregnancy, labour and birth, and into early
        postpartum.</p>
      <p>Even with a partner on the scene, I am there to offer hands-on support if desired, guide the partner through
        effective techniques, relieve the partner when a break is needed, and generally "read the room" to ensure a safe
        and nurturing environment for the labouring woman is created and maintained.
      </p>
      <!--purpose 2-->
      <h3>EMOTIONAL SUPPORT</h3>
      <p>The adventurous journey from pregnancy to parenting can be a wild ride!</p>

      <p>I offer authentic, caring check-ins, and a friendly listening ear. I will support you and your partner
        emotionally, as you navigate this path through the specific challenges of your journey.
      </p>
      <!--purpose 3-->
      <h3>INFORMATION AND ADVOCACY</h3>
      <p>With so much information out there, I help you find evidence-based information that sits well with your soul.
        As much as there is to learn on this journey, there is also much to unlearn to ensure you are being true to your
        authentic self. We will work through discovering what it is that you truly desire, and finding your voice to
        advocate for your vision.

      <h3>LAURIE DIETRICH, BIRTH DOULA</h3>
    </div>
    <!--About content-->
    <p>I have been eager to work in the birth field for many years. Now, as my children grow, and we've reached a point
      where the world won't fall apart without me if I'm away from home for an extended period of time, I am excited to
      be able to step into the birth-professional scene as a doula. Being a birth doula is a natural fit with my
      interests in birth and natural health, and my personality of being a nurturer. I look forward to this new chapter
      of being able to serve and support my community and share what knowledge I have accumulated (and just as
      importantly, what I have unlearned) over my 15 year parenting journey while at the same time, supporting you by
      respecting your unique choices and stepping back to let your journey unfold as it will. </p>
    <br>
    <p>I have trained with Discover Birth and am working towards full DONA Certification.</p>
